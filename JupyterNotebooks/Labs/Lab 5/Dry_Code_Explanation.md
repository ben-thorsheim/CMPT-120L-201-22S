# This is my explanation

1. First, I defined the multipliers as SAVINGS and CHECKINGS.
2. Next, I created a function when adding to the savings account.
3. Afterwards, I created a function for adding to the savings account where the total amount would be split by the SAVINGS and CHECKINGS into both accounts.
4. I used the original function for saturdays_bank_transactions to represent the beginning point of the two accounts.
5. Under the same function I input the values that will going into the checking account and the values that will be typed into the accounts in the next row.
6. Lastly, I kept the "if" statement to transfer the code and the data values for the transactions to be used in the code.
7. Generally, I made capacities for both accounts and condensed all of the exchanges into their comparing capacities whereas keeping the beginning focuses of the accounts and the "if" statement to modularize my code which incorporates the exchange values, the unused equalizations and what is printed.
